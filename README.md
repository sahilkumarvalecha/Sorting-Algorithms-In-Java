## 📝 Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are frequently used in a wide range of applications. This repository includes implementations of both comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorting techniques. Each algorithm is implemented with clear code structure and comments for better understanding.

## ✅ Implemented Algorithms

Below is the list of sorting algorithms implemented so far:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**

*More algorithms will be added over time.*
